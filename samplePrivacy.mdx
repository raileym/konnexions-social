<p>We provide this <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> to let you know what information we collect, how we use it, share it, and protect it. This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and Product.</p>
<p>BY ACCESSING THE SITE AND USING THE PRODUCT YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE SITE OR USING THE PRODUCT ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY OR BUSINESS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES DESCRIBED HEREIN ON THEIR BEHALF. IF YOU OR THE ENTITY DO NOT ACCEPT THESE POLICIES AND PRACTICES, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS SITE OR THE PRODUCT.</p>
<p>We understand your concerns about how your information is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly. This page explains how the information you provide is collected and used.</p>
<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>We may collect both <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong> about you and <strong>Non-Personally-Identifiable Information</strong> about your experience when you access the Site.</p>
<p>The Personally Identifiable Information we collect on the Site consists of information you submit to us, including your name, email address, and other personal information that you willingly provide. Because participation in these activities is voluntary, you have a choice whether or not to disclose such information.</p>
<p>In addition to information that you provide to us through forms, we receive Non-Personally Identifiable Information whenever you interact with the Site, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, geographical region, referral URLs, and other data automatically supplied by common web browsers.</p>
<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites?</strong></p>
<p>When you access the Site through a <strong>Third-Party Site (“TPS”)</strong>, including but not limited to social networking sites such as Facebook, we may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you from the profile you have established at the TPS.</p>
<p>By authorizing the Site to access your TPS profile, you are authorizing the Site to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that your privacy settings at the TPS allow the Site to access through the TPS Application Programming Interface (“API”).</p>
<p>The Personally Identifiable Information the Site is allowed to access is affected by the privacy settings you have established at the TPS. Because the linkage between any TPS and the Site is completely voluntary, and our ability to access your information at the TPS requires that linkage, you have a choice whether or not to disclose such information.</p>
<p><strong>How Is Your Information Used?</strong></p>
<p>Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We do not sell, rent, or lease your information to third parties.</p>
<p>The information we obtain from the Site users helps us enhance and refine our Product. Non-personal information collected about you through your experience and queries is used to better understand the entire population that is utilizing the Site and how we might improve our Product to improve the collective experience. Except as noted below, we track and record IP addresses that access the Site for internal reporting, diagnostic, and analysis purposes only.</p>
<p>If you choose to receive communication from the Site directly or via use of any submission forms associated with the website, we may send you an email response as well as notify you of other offers or Product that may be of interest. When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications to respond to you and improve our Product.</p>
<p>Your IP address is used to determine, when possible, your approximate geographical location, which affects such things as your results’ default currency and units of measure, based on what country you are in. Your browser type may be used to fine-tune the results for optimal display, for example on mobile devices or to work around limitations of a particular browser. Referrer URLs may be used to generate usage statistics and analyze usage patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Other Disclosures of Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We may release Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is necessary to comply with lawful court orders. Any collected information associated with your use of the website (personal and non-personal) will be disclosed to government authorities or third parties only pursuant to a lawful request, subpoena, or other process that legally compels disclosure of that information.</p>
