**Prior Discussion follow regarding forming smaller custom social networks**

Providing online social networking services via a website and mobile platforms for facilitating
personal connections and interactions within small social groups, including family and friends,
promoting social well-being, emotional support, and personal safety.

I also want to point out that our biggest advocates are the healthcare providers, institutions and
insurance companies, doctors and physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, social psychologists,
and researchers in group dynamics (how people behave in groups), behavior economics (do the right
thing), and loneliness (medical condition that stems from the lack of social connections).
Just saying. Our is clearly not a Where's The Party service.

The applicant’s services are further distinguished by their alignment with the goals of healthcare
providers, mental health professionals, and researchers in fields such as social psychology, 
behavioral economics, and group dynamics. The platform is designed to support individuals seeking
to strengthen personal connections as part of broader well-being and safety objectives recognized
by the medical and behavioral sciences community. This purpose clearly differentiates the
applicant’s services from social discovery and general communication platforms.

The applicant’s services are designed to promote and facilitate personal connections and social
interactions within trusted, private groups with the express goal of improving social well-being,
emotional support, and personal safety. These services are intended to strengthen social
capital—the positive benefits that arise from healthy, supportive relationships.

The applicant’s platform attracts individuals and groups seeking to strengthen trusted, private
social ties for the purpose of maintaining well-being, personal safety, and emotional health.
This focus appeals not only to users seeking deeper, ongoing connections but also to healthcare
professionals, mental health providers, insurance companies, behavioral economists, psychologists,
social psychologists, and researchers in group dynamics and loneliness, who recognize the health
and safety benefits of fostering social capital.
