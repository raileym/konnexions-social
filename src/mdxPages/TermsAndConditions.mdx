  <LegalBlock label='A'>
Welcome to MyKonnexions.com (the "**Site**"), an engagement portal (the "**Portal**") through which a customer (an "**End User**") accesses interactive technologies designed to promote meaningful engagement. The Portal is a browser-based system that blends traditional web capabilities—such as access to Common Documents like web pages, blogs, and text documents—with enhanced features (each an "**Engagement Feature**") that foster interaction, spark conversation, encourage participation, and support the End User in building stronger connexions with others.
  </LegalBlock>

  <LegalBlock label='B'>
When more than one Engagement Feature is available, the collection of these features is referred to as the "**Product Portfolio**." The term "**Product**" may refer to a single Engagement Feature or to any one or more features in the Product Portfolio.
  </LegalBlock>

  <LegalBlock label='C'>
The Engagement Features incorporate both deterministic and non-deterministic technologies. The non-deterministic elements include interaction with one or more Generative AI technologies (collectively, "**GenAI Technology**").

The Portal is hosted at MyKonnexions.com, a website owned and operated by Professor Malcolm's LLC, which conducts business under the Florida-registered fictitious name MY KONNECTIONS<sup className="f7 relative" style={{ top: '-1.2em' }}>TM</sup>.

  <LegalBlock label='E' disable={false}>
The Portal connects to the MY KONNEXIONS SOCIAL<sup className="f7 relative" style={{ top: '-1.2em' }}>TM</sup> Platform (the "**Platform**") to deliver a rich user experience. This experience is enhanced by GenAI Technology and designed to motivate engagement with the Portal.
