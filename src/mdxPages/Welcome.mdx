Welcome to the <MyKonnexionsTitleSpan fontSizeInRem={1.5} nominal="Social Platform" />, a technology platform developed and operated by Professor Malcolm's LLC, doing business as <MyKonnexionsTitleSpan fontSizeInRem={1.5} nominal="Social" />.

<MyKonnexionsTitleSpan fontSizeInRem={1.5} nominal="Social" /> is more than a name — it’s a mission-driven technology, education, and research initiative committed to strengthening the social ties that connect us, for everyone’s better health and well-being.

At <MyKonnexionsTitleSpan fontSizeInRem={1.5} nominal="Social" />, we focus on how people connect, why they connect, and why it matters.

While technology makes it easier to stay in touch, we believe it’s not enough on its own. Real connection takes more than just a signal — it needs purpose. That’s why we design tools and experiences that give people a reason to reach out: through shared interests, shared joy, and shared meaning.

Our work is inspired by the growing recognition — including the 2023 U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on the Healing Effects of Social Connection and Community, issued by Dr. Vivek H. Murthy — that human connection isn’t just nice to have. It’s essential. As the Advisory highlights, a lack of connection contributes to a public health crisis of loneliness, isolation, and disconnection. It affects our health, our happiness, and the well-being of our communities.

So we’re building interactive resources that make it easier (and more fun) to connect with others — whether you're learning a new language together, starting a book club, sharing a garden, or simply having a good laugh.

At the heart of it all is a simple idea: stronger connections make us stronger people. We’re here to spark real moments between real people — not just through apps or feeds, but through conversations, collaboration, and community.
