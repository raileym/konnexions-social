  Welcome to MyKonnexions.com (**Site**), which is the engagement portal (**Portal**) through which a customer (**End User**) gains access to the Site's interactive technologies that motivate their engagement. The Portal is 
  a browser-based technology that combines traditional 
  browser capabilities, such as access to  **Common Documents** like 
  web pages, blogs, and text documents, with enhanced capabilities (**Engagement Feature**) 
  that engage the End User with an interactive experience
  that sparks conversation, encourages participation, and positions our End User to better connect with others. 
  </LegalBlock>

  <LegalBlock label='B'>
  When there is more than one Engagement Feature, also referred to as the **Product**, then the set of Products comprise
  a **Product Portfolio**. The singular use of Product constitutes both a particular Product and any Product in the Product Portfolio

  <LegalBlock label='C'>
  The Engagement Features are based on a combination of deterministic and non-deterministic technologies, the
  latter of which involves interactions with one of several Generative AI Technologies (**GenAI Technology**).

  The Portal is hosted on MyKonnexions.com, a website owned and operated by Professor Malcolm&apos;s LLC, which delivers services under a Florida-registered ficticious name, 
  My Konnexions. Collectively, we refer to Professor Malcolm&apos;s LLC and My Konnexions as the **Company** (&apos;we&apos;, &apos;us&apos;, or &apos;our&apos;).

  Let's Konnect With Spanish Feature (**Basic Language Feature**). By using
  the Basic Language Feature, the End User augments their academic experience when 
  learning Spanish (**Source Language**). The Basic Language Feature (1) accepts a limited amount of arbitrary 
  Spanish content (**End User Content**), (2)
  transforms this Spanish content into an audio file (**MP3 File**), and then (3)
  translates the same content to English (**Target Language**). This translated
  version of the content is called the **Translation**.
