<h1 className="tcX secondary f3 f5-vvs f4-vs f3-s f2-m f1-ns">About <MyKonnexionsTitle className="ml2" slashColor='primary' fontSizeInRem={3} color='secondary' nominal={'Social'} /></h1>

<MyKonnexionsTitleSpan fontSizeInRem={1} nominal="Social" /> is a technology, education, and research company that promotes ways to strengthen the social ties that connect us for everyone’s better health and well-being.

Ours is a social mission, not a means to find an entertainment venue, not a safety check in declared emergency situations, and not a dating service. Ours is a mission to help people connect in deeper, more meaningful ways. 

Our mission is a direct response to the national call-to-action outlined by former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy in May 2023. His advisory, *Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation: The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on the Healing Effects of Social Connection and Community*, addresses the widespread crisis of loneliness and social disconnection across the United States. Dr. Murthy emphasized the serious consequences of this epidemic on mental, physical, and societal well-being and urged the nation to rebuild the social fabric through stronger, more meaningful personal connections  (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2023).

Unfortunately, in as much as Dr. Murthy has warned us about the degree and impact of our present pandemic of loneliness, how we can make sustained improvements to reverse the tide – creating greater social connectedness – is not well-understood and varies for each of us. Therefore, we qualify our mission as one that promotes ways to foster deeper connections, and not as a mission that promotes a single-point solution to meet this need.

So while technology can connect us, technology alone is not sufficient to strengthen our connections. Instead, sometimes the answer to deepening social connectedness lies with making people aware of its importance through informative research and education; while at other times, the answer lies with enabling people to engage with others using a shared social skill, e.g., speaking a foreign language or playing a game. Whatever the best approach, through technology, education, research, or some combination, our mission is singular to help strengthen our social ties for better health and well-being.

At <MyKonnexionsTitleSpan />, developing and supporting social skills is our primary thrust. Without the motivation to engage — often sparked by fun, shared activities — using technology solely to establish a connection proves ineffective. We believe technology must do more than link people; it must invite meaningful interaction through context-driven social skill use.

To that end, we promote tools from our <MyKonnexionsTitleSpan nominal={'Social Platform'} /> that help individuals build social skills in context — such as practicing a new language, cooking, gardening, or engaging in shared activities — which, in turn, support deeper personal connections. While we recognize the value of technology that facilitates direct connection, and we promote a broader platform however appropriate to strengthen human ties.
